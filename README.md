Vision
Lately helps humans write better marketing content in collaboration with artificial intelligence and software automation. (That collaboration part is key, btw. And is the basis of everything we do.)

Leading by example is core to our product and our belief. We walk the talk. And we do it, together.

Because Lately is a community. We see ourselves as an extension of our customers' marketing teams and we prioritize relatability and listening so they see us as not AI-powered software but as humans. We actively try to get to know each and every one of them and make ourselves available for them to get to know us.

Most importantly, we emphasize these beliefs internally, as well. Authenticity through honesty, collaboration, productive dialogue and a genuine desire to solve problems together is our lifeblood. As we are a community to our customers, we are also a community to ourselves; we recognize the magnitude of the journey we're on and rely upon each other to both acknowledge successes and work through challenges.

Together, in partnership with our customers, weâ€™re growing Lately into a new evolution of AI-content creation software that humans truly love. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:
Lately helps humans write better marketing content in collaboration with artificial intelligence and software automation. (That collaboration part is key, btw. And is the basis of everything we do.)

1.Each time your brain hears a new song, it automatically accesses every song youâ€™ve ever heard before.
2.Your brain then looks for familiar touch points in order to index that new song in your memory banks.
3.Every voice has a frequency, like a musical note. When you read text, you hear that voice inside your head.
4.Like a rock â€˜nâ€™ roll dj, itâ€™s the writer's job to give you familiar touch points in order to sell you something new.
5.Latelyâ€™s AI studies familiar touch points in order to create a writing model and then applies this writing model to transform longform content into something new.
